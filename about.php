                    <p>Itachi Uchiha (うちはイタチ, Uchiha Itachi) was a shinobi of Konohagakure's Uchiha clan who served as
                        an Anbu Captain. He later became an international criminal after murdering his entire clan,
                        sparing only his younger brother, Sasuke. He afterwards joined the international criminal
                        organisation known as Akatsuki, whose activity brought him into frequent conflict with Konoha
                        and its ninja — including Sasuke who sought to avenge their clan by killing Itachi. Following
                        his death, Itachi's motives were revealed to be more complicated than they seemed and that his
                        actions were only ever in the interest of his brother and village, making him remain a loyal
                        shinobi of Konohagakure to the very end.</p>
